# rtm_inv

IMPORTANT: This repository is work in progress! **Expect anything but stable code**!

Besides that `rtm_inv` is:
- a light-weight module to perform lookup-table based inversion of the radiative transfer models ProSAIL and (in the future) SPART.
- an attempt to build a  model to derive functional traits such as the leaf area index (LAI) from satellite imagery
